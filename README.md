Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a classic word-guessing game brought to life using Python, where players attempt to guess a hidden word letter-by-letter within a limited number of attempts.

🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to build a fun and interactive command-line version of Hangman, a popular game that tests your vocabulary and deductive skills. This project is perfect for learning and demonstrating basic Python skills such as control flow, loops, and basic data handling, while also introducing players to the logic of game development.

🛠️ Technologies Used

-Python 3: The game is built entirely in Python, utilizing core concepts like loops, conditionals, and list manipulation.
-Random Module: To select a random word from a list, ensuring each game session is different.

Custom Modules:
-hangman_words: Contains a list of words from which a random word is chosen for each game.
-hangman_art: Contains ASCII art to display the hangman at different stages of the game, adding a visual and engaging experience.

🚀 Features

-Random Word Selection: Every game session uses a different word from a pre-defined word list, making each playthrough unique.
-ASCII Art: Adds a visual element to the command-line interface, making the game more enjoyable.
-User-Friendly Messages: Provides feedback on guesses, informing users if they’ve already guessed a letter and when they've won or lost.
-Replayability: Players can enjoy multiple rounds with new words in each session.

📈 Impact

This project is a great way to:
-Improve Python programming skills by working on an interactive project.
-Develop logical thinking and problem-solving abilities by building game mechanics.
-Experience the excitement of game development with a retro ASCII-art twist.
-Create an engaging and fun CLI game that users can play repeatedly.
