A Hangman Game made in python 

Which imports different lists inside of modules for the hangman_art and hangman_words

Allows the user to guess letters and then let them known if they have already guessed the letter

If the letter is not in the chosen word, it will print the letter and let them known

Code constantly updates to tell the user how many lives they have left
- And changes the hangman art to match the lives left

In the end, if the user loses, the game will tell you the correct word, that they failed to guess
